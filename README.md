API for the Rock & Roll Ember.js application
============================================

A simple REST API written for the Ember.js application I'm building in my “Build an Ember app” screencast series.

The source code for the client-side application can be found [here](https://github.com/balinterdi/rock-and-roll).

You can sign up to [the Ember.js mailing list](http://emberjs.balinterdi.com) to see the screencast series in which I 
build the app step by step and also get Ember.js related articles, best practices tips and other screencasts.
